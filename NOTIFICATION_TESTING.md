# Notification System Testing Guide

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Basic API Testing

### Phase 3: Notification Creation Testing
Create test scenarios to trigger each notification type:

## üöÄ Quick Test Commands

### Run API Tests
```bash
node test-notifications.js
```

### Check Database for Notifications
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to Notification table to see created notifications
```

### Verify Prisma Schema
```bash
npx prisma validate
npx prisma generate
```

## üêõ Common Issues to Check

1. **Authentication Issues**: Ensure you're signed in when testing
2. **Database Connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
3. **Prisma Client**: Make sure `npx prisma generate` has been run
4. **API Responses**: Check console for any API errors
5. **TypeScript Errors**: Ensure no compilation errors exist

## üìä Expected Results

### Successful Test Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Notifications appear in the notification bell
- ‚úÖ Unread count updates when new notifications arrive
- ‚úÖ Notification preferences save correctly
- ‚úÖ All notification types can be triggered
- ‚úÖ No console errors during normal usage
- ‚úÖ Database contains notification records

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server console for API errors
3. Verify database schema with Prisma Studio
4. Test API endpoints directly with test script
5. Ensure all environment variables are set

## üéØ Test User Setup

For comprehensive testing, you'll need at least 2 test users:
1. **User A**: The actor (follows, comments, sends compliments)
2. **User B**: The recipient (receives notifications)

You can use the existing demo accounts:
- sarah@example.com / demo
- mike@example.com / demo  
- david@example.com / demo
