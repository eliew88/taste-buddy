This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TasteBuddy is a Next.js 15 recipe sharing platform built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma ORM. The application has evolved into a sophisticated culinary social network with advanced features including recipe books, meal memories, social following, achievements, and optional payment processing. It uses PostgreSQL for both development and production, and follows Next.js App Router architecture.
